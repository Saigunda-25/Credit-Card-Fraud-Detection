# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## 🎯 Objective
Build a binary classification model to detect fraudulent transactions using logistic regression.

## 📂 Dataset
[Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The dataset is highly imbalanced (only ~0.17% fraud cases)
- Logistic regression handles the problem with ~95% ROC-AUC
- Evaluation done using confusion matrix, precision/recall, and ROC curve

## 📈 Evaluation
- ROC-AUC Score: 0.955
- Precision (Fraud): High precision, low false positives
